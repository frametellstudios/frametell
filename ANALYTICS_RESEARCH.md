## UTM Parameter Strategy

### What Are UTM Parameters?

UTM parameters are tags added to URLs that track where traffic comes from. Example:

**Regular link:**

https://frametell.com/portfolio
```

**UTM-tagged link:**
```
https://frametell.com/portfolio?utm_source=instagram&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=wedding_showcase_jan2025
```

When someone clicks this link, Umami records:
- **Source:** Instagram
- **Medium:** Social media
- **Campaign:** Wedding showcase January 2025

## How to Use UTM Links

### Step 1: Generate UTM Links

Use a UTM builder tool:
- **Google Campaign URL Builder:** https://ga-dev-tools.google/campaign-url-builder/
- **Or I can create a spreadsheet template** with formulas to auto-generate links

### Step 2: Use in Social Media Posts

**Instagram Example:**
1. Create a post showcasing a wedding video
2. In caption, write: "Link in bio to see more wedding films!"
3. Update Instagram bio link to:
   ```
   https://frametell.com/videography?utm_source=instagram&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=wedding_jan2025&utm_content=bio_link
   ```
4. Post goes live
5. Users click bio link
6. Umami records: "5 visits from Instagram wedding campaign"

**Facebook Ad Example:**
1. Create Facebook ad for wedding videography
2. Set destination URL to:
   ```
   https://frametell.com/contact?utm_source=facebook&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=wedding_leads_feb2025&utm_content=video_ad
   ```
3. Ad runs for 2 weeks
4. Umami shows: "23 visits, 4 contact form submissions from Facebook wedding ad"
5. **ROI calculation:** Spent $200 on ads, got 4 inquiries, closed 1 wedding ($3,000 revenue) = 15x return

### Step 3: Analyze Results in Umami

**Weekly Review:**
1. Log into Umami dashboard
2. Go to **Reports** → **UTM Parameters**
3. See breakdown:
   - Instagram: 45 visits, 2 conversions
   - Facebook: 23 visits, 4 conversions
   - TikTok: 67 visits, 1 conversion
   - LinkedIn: 12 visits, 3 conversions
4. **Insight:** Facebook has best conversion rate (17%) despite lower traffic
5. **Action:** Increase Facebook ad budget, reduce TikTok spend

**Monthly Review:**
1. Compare campaigns:
   - Wedding showcase: 150 visits, 8 inquiries
   - Corporate video: 45 visits, 5 inquiries
   - Drone footage: 200 visits, 2 inquiries
2. **Insight:** Corporate video has highest conversion rate (11%)
3. **Action:** Create more corporate content, target business clients

## Event Tracking for Conversions

### What to Track

**High-Value Events:**
1. **Contact form submission** (primary conversion goal)
2. **Phone number click** (mobile users calling directly)
3. **Email address click** (users sending email)
4. **Portfolio category view** (interest signals)
5. **Video play** (engagement metric)
6. **Social media link click** (cross-platform tracking)

### How It Works

When someone submits contact form:
1. Umami records event: `contact_form_submit`
2. Includes UTM parameters: `utm_source=instagram`
3. Dashboard shows: "Contact form: 12 submissions this month"
4. Attribution report shows: "Instagram: 5, Facebook: 4, LinkedIn: 3"
5. **Business insight:** Instagram drives most inquiries → invest more in Instagram content

### Example: Tracking Contact Form

**Before (no tracking):**
- You get 10 inquiries/month
- No idea where they came from
- Can't optimize marketing spend

**After (with event tracking):**
- 10 inquiries tracked:
  - 4 from Instagram wedding posts
  - 3 from Facebook ads ($150 spent)
  - 2 from LinkedIn corporate content
  - 1 from Google search
- **ROI visible:** Facebook ads cost $150, generated 3 inquiries worth $9,000 potential revenue
- **Action:** Increase Facebook ad budget to $500/month

## Privacy & Compliance

### Why Privacy Matters for Your Business

**Trust Building:**
- Clients trust you with their wedding/event memories
- Respecting website visitor privacy reinforces that trust
- No creepy tracking = professional image

**Legal Compliance:**
- **GDPR** (Europe): Requires consent for cookies
- **CCPA** (California): Requires opt-out for data selling
- **New Zealand Privacy Act**: Requires transparency

**Umami's Privacy Approach:**
- **No cookies** = no consent banners needed
- **Anonymous tracking** = no personal data collected
- **Aggregate data only** = can't identify individuals
- **GDPR/CCPA compliant** by default

### What This Means Practically

**With Google Analytics:**
- Must show cookie banner: "This site uses cookies. Accept/Reject"
- ~15% of users reject or block
- Lose tracking data
- Annoying user experience

**With Umami:**
- No cookie banner needed
- 100% of visitors tracked (anonymously)
- Clean, professional site
- Better user experience = more conversions
